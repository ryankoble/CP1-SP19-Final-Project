# MIDI Visualized

Audio-visualization program that creates a tangible experience of interacting with MIDI, visually.

## Summary

This program utilizes a laptop connected to a MIDI controller to visualize MIDI signals from a keyboard. The MIDI signals are visualized as colored circles whose hue and y-axis location is determined by the velocity, and the x-axis location is determined by the notation of the signal.

## Components

This program requires Processing and the MidiBus library + MIDI keyboard + any DAW installed on the computer for creating sounds through VST instruments.

MIDI keyboard is plugged into laptop via a printer cable + USB-C adapter. External display is plugged into laptop via HDMI cable + USB-C adapter.

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 0: Write Proposal
- Week 1: Figure out MidiBus library
- Week 2: Connect the velocity and note values to circles that coincide with the keys
- Week 3: Finalize the visuals and create the demo audio and video
- Week 4: Present!

## Challenges

The most difficult part of this project was initially figuring out how to send MIDI signals to Processing and use velocity and notation as variables for the program. After I worked out this part of the project, I just had to spend time finalizing the visuals and the audio in Logic Pro X for the demo.
